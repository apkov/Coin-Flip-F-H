# Coin-Flip-F-H
https://apkov.github.io/Coin-Flip-F-H/

This project recreates the coin-flip mechanic from the Fear & Hunger series. It is a simple web page where you flip a coin using the original coin artwork and sound effects from the game. The result is always a straight 50/50 between heads and tails.

## Context in the Original Game
In Fear & Hunger, many actions are resolved through a simple heads-or-tails check. You pick a side, the coin flips, and the game decides the outcome with pure chance. These checks appear when exploring, interacting with objects, or during combat, adding constant risk to every decision.

## What This Project Does
This page recreates that mechanic in a simple form. You choose heads or tails, the coin flips, and you get the result. No tricks, no modifiers, just a clean 50/50 chance inspired by the original system.
