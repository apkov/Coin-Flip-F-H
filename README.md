# Coin-Flip-F-H
This project recreates the coin-flip mechanic from the Fear & Hunger series. It is a simple web page where you flip a coin styled after the one used in the games. The result is always a straight 50/50 between heads and tails.

How It Works

In Fear & Hunger, many events are decided by a heads-or-tails check. You are asked to pick a side, and the outcome determines whether something good happens or something bad happens. There is no way to influence it. It is pure chance.

Context in the Original Game

These coin checks appear in many situations: interacting with objects, exploring the map, or during combat. The mechanic is used to decide outcomes instantly, adding risk and uncertainty. You hope the coin lands your way. If not, the results can be severe.

What This Project Does

This page recreates that mechanic in a simple form. Press the button, the coin flips, and you get either heads or tails. No tricks, no modifiers, just a clean 50/50 chance inspired by the original system.
